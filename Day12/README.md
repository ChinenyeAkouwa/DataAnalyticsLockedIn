## Progress Update — Guided Sales Dashboard

Today’s work focused on strengthening the structure of the Excel Sales Dashboard currently in development. While the final dashboard is not yet ready for publication, I concentrated on foundational elements that shape usability and analytical clarity.

### Areas worked on

* Refining KPI definitions
* Writing supporting measures
* Connecting slicers to improve interactivity
* Reviewing layout decisions for user navigation

This phase highlighted how much of dashboard quality comes from behind-the-scenes setup rather than visuals alone. Continued iteration will focus on finalizing design and preparing the dashboard for sharing.
