Day 5 — Portfolio Strategy: Project Idea Bank

As part of my 120-day analytics challenge, today’s focus was generating potential project directions by identifying real-world problems that data could help address.
Rather than selecting generic case studies, I explored domains aligned with my personal interests and community involvement. The goal was to practice problem framing — an essential early step in the analytics lifecycle.

Identified Problem Areas

Movie performance trend analysis
Football match/player performance insights
Reader engagement patterns in romance literature
Text pattern exploration in biblical literature
Outreach participation and engagement analytics

Key Learning

This exercise reinforced that analytics projects begin with curiosity and structured questioning. Valuable portfolio work doesn’t require complex datasets initially — it requires clear problem framing and practical execution planning.

Next Steps

Prioritize projects based on data availability
Define scope and metrics
Begin structured implementation
