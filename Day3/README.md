## Daily Learning Note – Day 3: Applying the Analytics Lifecycle

Today I revisited my Castles Hotel Booking project and mapped it against the full analytics lifecycle.

### What I Did Well:
- Defined the business problem clearly.
- Performed thorough data cleaning and preparation.
- Conducted structured SQL-based exploratory analysis.
- Presented insights with recommendations and a dashboard.

### Gaps Identified:
- Analysis was primarily descriptive (focused on what happened).
- Limited diagnostic analysis to explain root causes (e.g., revenue drop and cancellations).
- No measurable KPIs defined at the start.
- No evaluation stage to validate whether recommendations would solve the problem.

### Reflection:
This exercise showed me that strong analytics requires more than clean data and good visuals. It requires intentional structure from problem definition to measurable impact. Going forward, I will incorporate clearer success metrics and deeper root cause analysis into my projects.
