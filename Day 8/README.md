Guided Excel Dashboard — Learning Reflection
What I Focused On

Started a guided Excel Interactive sales dashboard build while paying attention to the analytical process behind the visuals.

Key Observations

Understanding the domain provides context for interpreting data correctly

Thinking like a stakeholder helps define the problem being solved

Data cleaning takes a significant portion of the work

KPIs must be identified before meaningful analysis can happen

Measures should align directly with those KPIs

Takeaway

This exercise reinforced that dashboards are the final outcome of structured analytical preparation. The quality of the visualization depends heavily on understanding context, preparing data properly, and defining relevant metrics.

Next Steps

Apply this structured workflow while continuing the dashboard build and future portfolio projects.
