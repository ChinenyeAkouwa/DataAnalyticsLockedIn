## Daily Learning Note – Day 2: Career Reset

Today I reviewed strong data analytics portfolios to understand what makes them stand out. What became clear is that strong portfolios prioritize clarity over complexity. They tell a clear story, show personality, and make it easy to understand the purpose behind each project.

This exercise challenged me to think beyond technical execution and pay more attention to presentation, structure, and detail. It reminded me that portfolios are not just about what you build, but how others experience your work.

**Next step:** Start designing projects with storytelling and accessibility in mind.
