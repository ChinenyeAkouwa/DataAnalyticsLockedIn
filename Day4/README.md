## Day 4 – Skills Audit: Tool Knowledge vs Execution Ability

Today’s task focused on evaluating my current capabilities by separating tool knowledge from execution ability.

I assessed my comfort level across Excel, SQL, and Power BI and reflected on how effectively I apply them in real analytical work. While I am confident using these tools for data cleaning, structured querying, and building visual reports, I identified gaps in deeper analytical execution — particularly around defining measurable KPIs, modeling potential impact, and moving beyond descriptive insights.

I also acknowledged that I have not yet begun learning Python. Rather than viewing this as a deficiency, it provides clarity on a concrete next growth milestone.

### Key Takeaway
This exercise reinforced that familiarity with tools does not equal execution readiness. My next phase of development will prioritize strengthening analytical depth and measurable problem-solving rather than simply expanding my tool stack.
